Water (H₂O) is a transparent, tasteless, odorless inorganic compound essential for all life, forming oceans, rivers, and living organisms, existing as a liquid, solid (ice), or gas (vapor). Its unique polarity, V-shape, and strong hydrogen bonding make it the "universal solvent," crucial for biological processes like nutrient transport and temperature regulation, with properties like high specific heat, cohesion, and adhesion that support Earth's climate and ecosystems.
